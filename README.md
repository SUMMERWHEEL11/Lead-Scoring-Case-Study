### Objective

X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, aims to enhance its lead conversion process. Despite attracting many professionals through various marketing channels and referrals, their conversion rate is only around 30%. The company wants to identify "Hot Leads" — potential leads most likely to convert — to improve efficiency and boost their conversion rate. By focusing on these hot leads, the sales team can prioritize their efforts on the most promising prospects.

### Solution Overview

To address this challenge, we'll build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion, helping the sales team to target the right leads effectively.

### Steps Followed

1. **Reading Data**: Load the dataset containing information about the leads.
2. **Cleaning Data**: Perform data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand patterns and relationships.
4. **Creating Dummy Variables**: Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables for the model.
5. **Splitting Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.
6. **Building Model**: Develop a logistic regression model using the training data.
7. **Making Predictions**: Use the model to predict lead scores on the test data.
8. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using various metrics.
9. **ROC Curve**: Plot the ROC curve to visualize the model's performance.
10. **Prediction on Test Set**: Evaluate predictions on the test set to validate the model.
11. **Precision-Recall Analysis**: Analyze precision and recall to further gauge the model's effectiveness.
